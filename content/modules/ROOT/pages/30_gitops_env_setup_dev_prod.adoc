# Environment Install and Setup: DEV and PROD Cluster

## Parasol-insurance-dev cluster

Follow the following steps to complete the install and setup:

* After the cluster is running and ready, log in as the admin

* Copy the login token as shown in the image. Paste it in the terminal and run it. This should log you into the cluster through the terminal.

If you have certificate errors to login to the cluster, remember to use `--insecure-skip-tls-verify=true` in the login command.

====
* Log into your git account and fork the following repository:
----
https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator.git
----

* Once forked, clone the repository to your local machine.
[source,terminal]
----
git clone https://github.com/{Git_ID}/ai-accelerator.git
----

* Navigate to the cloned folder with the command:
[source,terminal]

The ai-accelerator project uses Kustomize and GitOps/ArgoCD to deploy our project. It uses the `bootstrap.sh` script to deploy GitOps on the cluster. After GitOps is installed onto the cluster, it will then apply an overlay.

The overlay determines which folder/versions to apply to the cluster. This allows you to reuse components and files across multiple instances with different setups.

In our case, we want to set up a _parasol-insurance-dev_ overlay.

. Open the the redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator fork that was cloned earlier in your code editor.

. Change the git `repoUrl` at `components/argocd/apps/base/tenants-applicationset.yaml` to your forked repository URL.

+
[.bordershadow]
image::01_change_repo_url.png[Change repoUrl]

. Next lets create a new overlay named `parasol-insurance-dev`. Copy `components/argocd/apps/overlays/rhoai-stable-2.19` and paste it as `components/argocd/apps/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev`.

. Change the `line 7` of the `patch-cluster-config-app-of-apps.yaml` file to `path: clusters/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev`.

+
[.bordershadow]
image::02_patch_cluster_path.png[Patch cluster path]

. Change the `line 3` of the `patch-tenants-applicationset.yaml` file to `value: tenants/_*/*_/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev`.

+
[.bordershadow]
image::03_patch_applicationset.png[Patch application set]

. Next, create a new folder under the `bootstrap/overlays` folder named `parasol-insurance-dev`.

+
[.bordershadow]

. In the `bootstrap/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev` folder, create a new file named `kustomization.yaml` add the below to the file.

+
.kustomization.yaml

[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1

- ../../../clusters/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev
----

+
[IMPORTANT]
As you can see, the Kustomization resource from above is referencing the `clusters/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev` folder. Let's create that folder

. Create a new folder named `parasol-insurance-dev` in the `clusters/overlays` folder.

. In the `clusters/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev` folder, create a new file named `kustomization.yaml` add the below content to the file:

+
.kustomization.yaml

. In the `clusters/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev` folder, create a new file named `patch-applicationset-manual-sync.yaml` add the below content to the file:

.patch-applicationset-manual-sync.yaml

[.console-input]

  path: /spec/source/targetRevision
  value: main
----

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Replace `{GIT_ID}` with your GitHub ID.
====

. In the `tenants` folder, create a new folder named `parasol-insurance`.
Here is where we'll be adding our new resources.

. In the `tenants/parasol-insurance` folder, create a folder named `namespaces`

. In the `tenants/parasol-insurance/namespaces` folder, create the `base` and `overlays` folders.

+
NOTE: Remember to add the `base` and `overlays` files and folders. Make sure you have the `parasol-insurance-dev` overlay in the `overlays` folder for Argo to pick up what it needs for the _parasol-insurance-dev_ environment.

. In the `tenants/parasol-insurance/namespaces/base` folder, create a new file named `kustomization.yaml` add the below content to the file:

+
.kustomization.yaml

[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
  - parasol-insurance.yaml
----

. In the `tenants/parasol-insurance/namespaces/base` folder, create a new file named `parasol-insurance.yaml` add the below content to the file:

+
.parasol-insurance.yaml

[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: parasol-insurance
  labels:
    opendatahub.io/dashboard: "true"
    kubernetes.io/metadata.name: parasol-insurance
    modelmesh-enabled: "true"
----

. In the `tenants/parasol-insurance/namespaces/overlays` folder, create a new folder named `parasol-insurance-dev`.

. In the `tenants/parasol-insurance/namespaces/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev` folder, create a new file named `kustomization.yaml` add the below content to the file:

+
.kustomization.yaml

[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1

----

+
[TIP]
====
The `opendatahub.io/dashboard: "true"` label is used to identify the namespace as a RHOAI data science project.

Our first component for the _parasol-insurance_ tenant is the namespace.

This namespace is defined to be created in the `parasol-insurance-dev` environment as per the `parasol-insurance-dev` overlay.

. Push the changes to your forked repository.

.push_changes

[.console-input]
[source,terminal]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Add parasol-insurance-dev overlay"
git push origin main
----

. Make sure you are logged into the _**Dev**_ cluster and run the bootstrap script by running the bootstrap.sh script.
+
[source,terminal]
----
./bootstrap.sh
...

1. parasol-insurance-dev        5. rhoai-fast-aws-gpu
2. rhoai-eus-2.16-aws-gpu       6. rhoai-stable-2.19-aws-gpu

+
[NOTE]
====
For _**parasol-insurance-dev**_ environments type the number 1 and press Enter.
====

. After the script is done, you can check the ArgoCD console to see the applications deployed. It will install RHOAI and relevent operators.

[TIP]
====
Notice that the `parasol-insurance-namespaces` application was also deployed.
====

. Navigate to RHOAI, and validate that there is a data science project created with the name _parasol-insurance_.

## Parasol-insurance-prod cluster
The steps to set up the _**parasol-insurance-prod**_ cluster are the same as _parasol-insurance-dev_, except change _dev_ to _prod_ in the kustomization files and folders.

Make the changes for _prod_ in your forked repository and use it to set up the _prod_ cluster.

When running the bootstrap script, select `bootstrap/overlays/parasol-insurance-prod`

## Questions for Further Consideration

Additional questions that could be discussed for this topic:

. How familiar are your development teams with CI/CD concepts?
. How do you currently deploy project to development, QA and Production environments?
. Is ArgoCD new to the team?
