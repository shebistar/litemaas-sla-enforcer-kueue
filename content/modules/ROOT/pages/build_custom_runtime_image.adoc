# Custom Runtime Images in RHOAI

## Need for custom runtime image 

RHOAI provides pre-build runtime images like Datascience with Python 3.11 (UBI9), Pytorch with CUDA and Python, Tensorflow with CUDA and Python etc. Data scientists can use these images to run their notebooks and projects.

These images come with most of the packages that one would need to run their Data Science projects. However, there might be cases where the user needs to install additional packages that are not available in the pre-built images. In such cases, the user can create a custom runtime image with the required packages. 

### Notebooks Repository
The https://github.com/opendatahub-io/notebooks/tree/main[notebooks repository] uses a `makefile` to create the runtime image. The `makefile` is a file that contains a set of directives used by a make build automation tool to build a set of target images. 

Take a look at the https://github.com/opendatahub-io/notebooks/blob/main/docs/developer-guide.md[developer guide] to understand the runtime image build chain.

## Creating a custom runtime image

### Using Podman to run the builder container:
We have created a container image that contains all the necessary tools to build the notebooks repository. This image is based on the repository: https://github.com/containers/image_build. You can find the image contents here: https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/rhoai-platform-foundation-bootcamp-instructions/tree/main/custom-notebook-builder-container/podman/Containerfile. This image is based on the latest fedora image and contains: podman, git, make, which, go, pip, python3.11 and pipenv. 

The image has already been built for you and is located here: `quay.io/asheet/custom-nb-builder-container:latest`.

We can run this image using Podman and build/push our custom notebooks from within the container. 

. Run the following command to run the container on podman:

[.console-input]
[source,terminal]
----
podman run -it --privileged --name custom-notebook-builder quay.io/asheet/custom-nb-builder-container:latest
----  

If running on an M-powered Mac, you will need to use the `--platform linux/amd64` flag to run the container.
[.console-input]
[source,terminal]
----
podman run -it --privileged --platform linux/amd64 --name custom-notebook-builder quay.io/asheet/custom-nb-builder-container:latest
----  

This will run the container and you will now be inside the container.

. Clone the notebooks git repository with the following command:

+ 
[.console-input]
[source,terminal]
----
git clone https://github.com/opendatahub-io/notebooks.git
----

. Navigate into the folder you just cloned.

+
[.console-input]
[source,terminal]
----
cd notebooks
----

. Log into the quay.io registery from your CLI. 

+
.Generate quay.io cli password from settings

====
Log into https://quay.io[quay.io] and go to _**Account Settings**_ in the top right. In the Account settings, _**Generate Encrypted Password**_.

Enter your password and then choose the _**Podman Login**_ or _**Docker Login**_ tab. Use this when logging into quay.io from Podman or Docker.
====

+
[.console-input]
[source,terminal]
----
podman login -u='username' -p='password' quay.io
----

. Open the _**Makefile**_ and try to understand the build chain.

. Let's add a Python Package to the runtime image-datascience-ubi9-python-3.11 image. 

. Change directory to the `runtimes/datascience/ubi9-python-3.11` directory.

+
[.console-input] 
[source,terminal]
----
cd runtimes/datascience/ubi9-python-3.11 
----

. Open the _**Pipfile**_ in the `runtimes/datascience/ubi9-python-3.11` directory. This file contains the list of Python packages that are installed in the image.

. Add a new Python package to the _**Pipfile**_. For example, let's add the `art` package to the _**Pipfile**_ to match the custom notebook image built in earlier exercise. 

+
After line 21, add the following line and save the file:

+
[.console-input]
[source]
----
art = "~=6.4.0"
----

. Use `pipenv lock` to add the new package to the `Pipfile.lock`. This updates the pip lock file with the new package. Run the following command:

+
[.console-input]
[source,terminal]
----
pipenv lock
----

. We will need to update the `requirements.txt` file. The notebooks repository has a handy script that will do this for us. Run the following command (still in the `runtimes/datascience/ubi9-python-3.11` directory):

+
[.console-input]
[source,terminal]
----
../../../scripts/sync-requirements-txt.sh
----

+
You can now see that the **_Art_** package has been added to the `requirements.txt` file. As well as updating some of the existing packages.

. Now that we have added the new package to the image, we need to build the runtime image. Change directory to the root of the repository project. After running this command you should be in the `notebooks` directory.

+
[.console-input]
[source,terminal]
----
cd ../../../
----

. Let's build the runtime-datascience-ubi9-python-3.11 image. Run the following command:
+

[.console-input]
[source,terminal]
----
make runtime-datascience-ubi9-python-3.11 -e  IMAGE_REGISTRY=quay.io/{quay_id}/runtime-images  -e  RELEASE=2024b
----

+
.If using gmake
[%collapsible]
====
[.console-input]
[source,terminal]
----
gmake runtime-datascience-ubi9-python-3.11 -e  IMAGE_REGISTRY=quay.io/{quay_id}/runtime-images  -e  RELEASE=2024b
----
====

+

Note: If you're on a M-powered Mac, you need to build with `--platform linux/amd64`. In the Makefile, you can add the _**--platform linux/amd64**_ build arguments to the container build command. Edit **line 77** in the **Makefile** to be: `$(eval BUILD_ARGS := --platform linux/amd64)`

+
This takes some time to build. It will build the base image first and then build the image on top of the base image. The image will then be pushed to the quay.io registry under your account in the **_runtime_** folder.

. Check your quay registry to see the image you just built. https://quay.io/repository/{quay_id}/runtime-images?tab=tags[https://quay.io/repository/{quay_id}/runtime-images?tab=tags]

+

. A new repository named `runtime-images` will get created in your quay.io account. This will get created as a Private repository. Convert it into a public repository in the settings.

+
. If your not able to build runtime-image, you can use the pre-built image `quay.io/arckrish/custom-runtime-images:runtime-datascience-ubi9-python-3.11-2024b_20250527` as a custom runtime image.

. You can now use this image in your custom notebook. Open custom-workbench in parasol-insurance project.

### Questions for Further Consideration

. What are the other ways to create a custom image for RHOAI? 

+

. How does the choice of runtime environment impact the performance of pipeline execution?

+

. Are there specific compliance or regulatory requirements that the image must meet?
