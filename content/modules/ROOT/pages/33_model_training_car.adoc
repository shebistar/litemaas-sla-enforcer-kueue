# Model Training with Custom Notebook

In this module you will sync a git repo, and then execute the logic contained in the parasol-insurance Jupyter notebooks. 

To perform this task, we will use the custom data science notebook image we created and uploaded in the previous module. 

## Steps to create workbench with a custom notebook

. In RHOAI, navigate to the `parasol-insurance` data science project, and select the `Workbenches` tab

. From the `Workbenches` tab, click on the `Open` button to open the workbench
